  * reimport Trove blueprints for [Spring Edition](http://forums.trovegame.com/showthread.php?12977-Spring-Edition#post64097)
  * Qubicle: fix orientation issues with right handed z coords and migrated Renderer to use right handed coords instead of left handed
  * Editor: added support for big models (lair / dungeon sized models)
  * added new frequently requested render options:
    * render mode options: render the model either in pretty (handle all material maps) or show only the color, alpha, type or specular map
    * wireframes: render the model either without wireframes, with darkgrey wireframes or with wireframes representing the color, alpha, type or specular ma√º
  * libTroxel: major API improvements (changing Options after initialisation, even the new render options (see above))
    * better camera position (autorotation should now fit from every angel, empty y voxel space is now ignored)
    * support for changing the rendered voxel model in the same canvas / WebGLContext
    * improved [libTroxel example page](https://chrmoritz.github.io/Troxel/static/libTroxelTest.html) showing off all the new features
  * reimport Trove blueprints for [Everything Edition](http://forums.trovegame.com/showthread.php?12486-Everything-Edition#post58045) + import rings
  * new vertex based Renderer
    * the new renderer is 5+ times faster on normal sized models and even better on big models (you can view very big models without lag now) than the old renderer
    * improved rendering of transparent / glass material maps
