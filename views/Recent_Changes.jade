  * added new frequently requested render options:
    * render mode options: render the model either in pretty (handle all material maps) or show only the color, alpha, type or specular map
    * wireframes: render the model either without wireframes, with darkgrey wireframes or with wireframes representing the color, alpha, type or specular ma√º
  * libTroxel: major API improvements (changing options and voxel model after initialisation, better camera position, improved [example](https://chrmoritz.github.io/Troxel/static/libTroxelTest.html))
  * new vertex based Renderer (a very lot faster than old renderer, can renderer big models without lag, improved glass rendering)
